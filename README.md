# About

New project! I have been working in a Debian and Plesk environment for a very long time.

But I decided to stop working with Plesk which does all the work for me ðŸ˜….

So I'm challenging myself to create a small tool to install a web server, with a complementary tools for example to add clients with a chroot that will host their sites...

I'm still a student so don't imagine a perfect thing, I count on your help to improve this project ðŸ˜‰
